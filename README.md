# Canadian, U.S. and Chinese Nowcasting

This project is based on the the [New York Fed Staff Nowcasting Report](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/nowcast) released every Friday.
The macroeconomic indicators generated by this nowcasting model were used to build commodity investment strategies.

This code implements the nowcasting framework described in "[Macroeconomic Nowcasting and Forecasting with Big Data](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr830.html)" by Brandyn Bok, Daniele Caratelli, Domenico Giannone, Argia M. Sbordone, and Andrea Tambalotti, Staff Reports 830, Federal Reserve Bank of New York (prepared for Volume 10 of the Annual Review of Economics).
